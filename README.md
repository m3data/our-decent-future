# OUR DECENT FUTURE  
*Collaborative blueprints for the future*

> 🕰️ **NOTE**: This README is preserved as a snapshot of my thinking circa 2016.  
> Written in a manic burst of visionary energy, it reflects an early attempt to grapple with futures-thinking, open-source collaboration, and techno-cultural narratives. While many of these ideas have since evolved—see [Rainbow Mirrors: Technology and Our Collective Moral Imagination (IEEE, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1109/MTS.2024.3398738)—this stands as a raw record of one node in the journey.

## What is this?

This project is focused on collaborating with people and communities to design future systems for living.  
It is a **lifelong project** to create a world for future generations to inherit. One that is about improving the life and wellbeing of all people.

## 🌗 White Mirrors

For the past century, the collective psyche has been primed with fear to see the worst of the possible futures.  
This has been a dominant theme—amplifying our sense of hopelessness and inevitability.  

Think:  
- Orwell's *1984*  
- Huxley’s *Brave New World*  
- *Terminator*, *The Matrix*, *Black Mirror*  

In 2010, I took a university subject called *Utopias and Dystopias*.  
It cracked something open in me—revealing how narrative shapes social possibility.  

Yes, the dark side is easy.  
But when you look in the mirror, what do you want to see?

**The idea of a “White Mirror”** emerged from this reflection—an attempt to hold both the light and the shadow, and still choose to create the world we want to live in.

## The Vision

This was meant to be an initiative to:
- Bring people together across disciplines and contexts
- Imagine, co-design, and architect blueprints for a future worth inheriting
- Curate and consolidate ideas, projects, thinkers, and doers
- Crowdsource a vision, and **decentralize the work**

Inspired by the [Free/Libre Open Source Software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), this was envisioned as an open collaborative project with no commercial center—**for the commons**.

## How?

I wasn’t entirely sure.  
But that was part of the charm. GitHub felt like the right place—a version-controlled collective journal of sorts.  

Planned features at the time included:
- A podcast series
- Community forums
- Regular blog content
- Invitations to contribute visions, blueprints, and skills

## Tools, Methods & Next Steps (original intention)

This project imagined:
- Using existing open-source tools
- Evolving into its own decentralised platform
- Empowering a network of contributors across time and space

There was no rush. It was always meant to unfold over a lifetime.

## Principles and Values

Originally intended to be collaboratively written, forkable, and translated by others.  
(The document referenced here was never completed, but the intention remains alive in newer work.)

## Addendum

> Since this README was written, the framing has evolved significantly—from *white mirrors* to **rainbow mirrors**—a concept that holds plurality, neurodiversity, and moral imagination at its core.  
> For a deeper look at that evolution, read:
